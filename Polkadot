# Web3 Reward System

This project is a Web3 application built using Hardhat and Next.js, featuring a smart contract (RewardToken) deployed on the Moonbase network. The frontend interacts with the smart contract via MetaMask. This is a part of a larger application, which can be found ttps://github.com/fitclash check out th live demo https://fitclash.vercel.app/?call=2&number=962


## Overview

The Web3 Reward System enables users to connect their MetaMask wallet, complete milestones (e.g., star jumps), and mint reward tokens upon completion. The smart contract is deployed on the Moonbase Alpha test network. For more details, visit the main application repository https://github.com/fitclash
or check the demo https://fitclash.vercel.app/?call=2&number=962

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (>=14.x.x)
- npm (>=6.x.x)
- Metamask (browser extension)
- Hardhat
- A Moonbase Alpha account (for deployment and testing)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web3-reward-system.git
cd web3-reward-system

Install the dependencies:
npm install
Configuration
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
MOONBASE_URL=https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network
NEXT_PUBLIC_MOONBASE_URL=https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network
NEXT_PUBLIC_REWARD_TOKEN_ADDRESS=YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
Replace your_private_key_here with your actual private key and YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS with the actual contract address after deployment.

Usage
Compile Contracts
To compile the smart contracts, run:

npm run compile
Deploy Contracts
To deploy the smart contracts to the Moonbase Alpha network, run:

npm run deploy
Run Frontend
To run the Next.js frontend application, run:

npm run dev
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the application.

Deployment
The deployment script is located in the scripts/ directory. To deploy the RewardToken contract, use:

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network moonbase
Testing
Run tests for the smart contracts:

npm run test
Scripts
compile: Compiles the smart contracts.
test: Runs the test suite.
deploy: Deploys the smart contracts to the specified network.
coverage: Generates a test coverage report.
lint: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
format: Formats the codebase using Prettier.
dev: Runs the Next.js development server.

UPDATE 24/08
Updated README for Improved MetaMask Integration and State Initialization
Overview
This update introduces improvements in error handling, user feedback, and state initialization for the MetaMask integration in our application. The changes include implementing toast notifications for better user feedback and initializing state variables with meaningful default values to enhance the user experience.

1. Error Handling and User Feedback
To provide users with a more intuitive experience, we've enhanced the MetaMask integration logic to include user-friendly error messages and notifications. This ensures users are promptly informed of any issues, such as when MetaMask is not detected.

Changes Made:
Installed react-toastify for notifications:

We added the react-toastify library to display toast notifications. This helps notify users of connection statuses and errors interactively.

Installation Command:

bash
Copy code
npm install react-toastify
Updated MetaMask Connection Logic:

The connectMetaMask function in UseMetaMask.js now includes error handling that uses toast notifications to inform the user if MetaMask is not detected or if there is an error during the connection process.

Example Code Update:

jsx
Copy code
// UseMetaMask.js
import { toast } from 'react-toastify';

const connectMetaMask = async () => {
  if (typeof window.ethereum === 'undefined') {
    toast.error('MetaMask is not detected. Please install MetaMask to continue.');
    return;
  }

  try {
    // Your MetaMask connection logic
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error(`Error connecting to MetaMask: ${error.message}`);
  }
};
Configured Toast Notifications in the Main App Component:

We added a ToastContainer to the main app component to ensure that all notifications are displayed correctly.
